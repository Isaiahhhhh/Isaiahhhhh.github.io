                   John von Neumann has been acknowledged for creating the merge sort algorithm where the first and second halves of an array are each sorted and then the array was merged together. John von Neumann had written 23 pages on the long sorting program on the EDVAC (the EDVAC was one of the earliest electronic computers.). The First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC, notes that were written by John had described the computer architecture in which the data and the program are both stored in the computer's memory in the same address space. This kind of architecture for a computer is still used today in computers. Until technology had advanced substantially and one system bus could be used and be provided at a lower cost. Von Neumann created the field of cellular automata without the help of computers, building the first self-replicating automata with pencil and paper in 1948.  Ulan and von Neumann had created a method for figuring out liquid motion, the driving idea of the method was to consider each as its own individual units and or groups then they would calculate the motion of each unit based on the motion of the nearby unit(s). In 1952 von Neumann had created the first 2D cellular automation. This cellular automation that von Neumann had created was considered to be the world's first computer virus. (This could even be considered to be a worm as these programs are also able to self-replicate.} von Neumann is now considered the “theoretical father of computer virology”.

                Von Neumann's team performed the world's first numerical weather forecasts on the ENIAC computer; von Neumann published the paper Numerical Integration of the Barotropic Vorticity Equation in 1950. Von Neumann's interest in weather systems and meteorological prediction led him to propose manipulating the environment by spreading colorants on the polar ice caps to enhance absorption of solar radiation (by reducing the albedo), thereby inducing global warming. Von Neumann was a scientist to propose the theory of global warming, noting that the Earth was only 6 °F (3.3 °C) colder during the last glacial period, he said that the burning of coal and oil would result in "a general warming of the Earth by about one degree Fahrenheit."
