    <h2>The Early Life of John von Neumann</h2>
        
        <p>
        John on Neumann was born on December 28th, 1903.When john was only 6 years old he was speaking Ancient Greek, one of the many languages he would learn at that age, additionally john was able to divide two eight-digit numbers in his head. John Von Neumann was a classic child prodigy. By the time von was eight years old he was familiar with differential and integral calculus, kids in Hungary did not even begin schooling until they were ten years of age. Von Neumann had attended the reputable secondary school, the Lutheran Gymnasium. The school system had taught many other prominent students, one such as Theodore von Karman. When john was fifteen years old he was being tutored by Gabor Szego in advanced calculus, on the day of their first meeting Szego was brought to tears by the aptitude that John had displayed in mathematics. Four years later and Von Neumann is nineteen and he published two mathematical papers, one of these papers had specified the modern definition for ordinal numbers, one of his first contributions to mathematics. He won the national Eötvös prize for mathematicians, the same year. Von Neumann would go on to study chemistry along with mathematics at the university of Budapest. He only took chemistry as his father thought that mathematics was not a practical field to study

        <h2>More About John von Neumann</h2>
        
        <p>Von Neumann was the youngest person ever to complete habilitation, john        would start his lectures as a privatdozent at the university of Berlin in 1928. John Vonn Neumann had taught at many different university’s some that were in Europe, like the university of Hamburg, until in October of 1929 he was invited to teach at Princeton University.

In 1933 he was given the opportunity to be a lifetime professor at the institute for Advanced study he would remain a mathematics professor there until his death. New Year's Day 1930, von Neumann would marry Marrietta Kovesi who had also studied at the university of Budapest. Though they would not live the rest of their days together they had a child, Marina born in 1935. The couple would divorce two years later. Marina as of 2017 is a professor of business administration and public policy at the university of Michigan.

        <h2>The Manhattan Project</h2>
            <p>
        John Von Neumann was apart of the Manhattan Project, he designed the explosive lenses that were needed, for the Fat Man, that would be dropped on Nagasaki. John Von Neumann came around to creating the strategy of Mutual assured destruction. After the war had ended von Neumann had insisted that the U.S. keeps manufacturing nuclear weapons, as he knew the USSR would be doing the exact same thing. Von Neumann was anti-communist and much more militaristic, he was quoted with saying this at a senate committee hearing, "If you say why not bomb [the Soviets] tomorrow, I say, why not today? If you say today at five o'clock, I say why not one o'clock?" This quote basically sums up his political ideology. Vonn Neumann's hydrogen bomb that he had created was simulated on a computer.
