        <h1>Contributions to Mathematics</h1>
        <p>
        Von Neumann had made a multitude of contributions to mathematics. Two of the theories he had worked on in the field of mathematics are Lattice theory, and game theory. The pages that he had written on lattice theory were said to give you a “razor-sharp impression of Von Neumann's mind”. In 1918 von Neumann wrote and published the “Theory of Parlor Games” this paper had a significant role in the field of game theory. In this paper he had proved his famous minimax theorem. The mini-max theorem Game theory was often use in the field of economics, but he wanted to apply this method to warfare. He had predicted the allies victory applying some of the methods from game theory. Yet another contribution that von Neumann had made was mathematical economics. Von Neumann had proved the existence of an equilibrium with his model of an expanding economy. What had got von Neumann to write the 9-page paper on mathematical economics was his friend that had recommended a book for Neumann to read by the mathematical economist Nicholas Kaldor, von Neumann had found faults that laid within the book and began to correct them. He would replace many things in the book that eventually would turn into the book that being replacing equations by inequalities, and introducing dynamic equilibria.

        <h2>Ergodic theory</h2>
        <p>
        In a series of articles that were published in 1932, von Neumann made foundational contributions to ergodic theory, a branch of mathematics that involves the states of dynamical systems with an invariant measure. Of the 1932 papers on ergodic theory, Paul Halmos writes that even "if von Neumann had never done anything else, they would have been sufficient to guarantee him mathematical immortality". By then von Neumann had already written his famous articles on operator theory, and the application of this work was instrumental in the von Neumann mean ergodic theorem.
