    <h2>The Early Life of John von Neumann</h2>
        
        <p>
        John on Neumann was born on December 28th, 1903.When john was only 6 years old he was speaking Ancient Greek, one of the many languages he would learn at that age, additionally john was able to divide two eight-digit numbers in his head. John Von Neumann was a classic child prodigy. By the time von was eight years old he was familiar with differential and integral calculus, kids in Hungary did not even begin schooling until they were ten years of age. Von Neumann had attended the reputable secondary school, the Lutheran Gymnasium. The school system had taught many other prominent students, one such as Theodore von Karman. When john was fifteen years old he was being tutored by Gabor Szego in advanced calculus, on the day of their first meeting Szego was brought to tears by the aptitude that John had displayed in mathematics. Four years later and Von Neumann is nineteen and he published two mathematical papers, one of these papers had specified the modern definition for ordinal numbers, one of his first contributions to mathematics. He won the national Eötvös prize for mathematicians, the same year. Von Neumann would go on to study chemistry along with mathematics at the university of Budapest. He only took chemistry as his father thought that mathematics was not a practical field to study
